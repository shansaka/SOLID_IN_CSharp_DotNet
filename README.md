# SOLID principles in C# .Net

If you're checking this you might be new to SOLID, but have an idea about programming languages such as C#, Java, etc. But knowing how to code is not make you a good software developer. Every developer should have a good understaning on SOLID principles. 
These are basic descriptions of SOLID principles,

* SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): A class should have only one reason to change.
* OCP (Open/Closed Principle): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the desirable properties of the program.
* ISP (Interface Segregation Principle): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Instead, it's better to have multiple smaller interfaces tailored to the needs of clients.
* DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

This repositiory has projects for each principle crated using C#, go through them to undersatand the basic SOLID principles.
