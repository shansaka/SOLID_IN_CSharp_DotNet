The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a module without modifying its source code.

In this example, 
We have base class Shape with abstact method Area(), so Circle and Rectangle will implementing the Area() method to calculate their respective areas.
